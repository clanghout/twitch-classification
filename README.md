# Twitch categories

In this project, we attempt to create a classifier to categorize multimedia streams on the live video streaming platform [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) into multiple genres.
To do so, we extract the messages from Twitch chat, the chat lobby accompanying every Twitch stream, and classify it by means of different features of the chat log.
The genres of streams that we classify into, are based on our own categorisation and [Twitch Communities](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/communities):
- Competitive/eSports
- Variety
- Speedrunning
- Chill and Relax
- Educational (Game)
- Educational (Programming, Drawing)
- Game Making
- Cooking
- Music
- Real Talk/Podcast
